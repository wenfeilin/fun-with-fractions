2. The two programs, InteractiveCalculator.java and QuickCalculator.java, emulate simple calculators, using the classes BigFraction and BFCalculator, the former being an interactive calculator and the latter being a command-line input-style calculator, that can compute expressions involving basic operators, integers, and fractions and store values with the use of registers.
3. SamR: For providing most of the class BigFraction in the "Designing your own classes" lab (https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC207/2023Fa/code/labs/intro-classes/Fraction.java)
   Madel Sibal: For working on the multiply method for the class BigFraction with me during lab
   StackOverflow: For providing general answers to problems I stumbled across, those of the nature of "why can't I use .equals to compare an object and null" and for help troubleshooting some errors I received on the terminal when compiling files
